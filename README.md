## 👀 About the project
A friend of mine started playing around in FL Studio at the beginning of 2020. Soon enough he was able to create fairly decent beats, and decided it was time to get some tunes out there. Casper had a simple Bootstrap website running by March 2020. This didn't go unnoticed. Due to the corona crisis, I was able to create spare time, and decided to help him out a little.

## 🎓 Experience
In preparation of building another iteration of my own portfolio site I decided to learn Gatsby. Gatsby is a React framework that's used to create static web pages. It offers every handy React depency out of the box; there's no need to configure pages, routes or metadata. Another benefit Gatsby has to offer is its performance. Gatsby automates code splitting, image optimization, lazy loading, and so much more.

**What I learned in this project:**
* Create custom media players
* Convert Markdown files to html using GraphQL and Gatsby's markdown-remark plugin
* Page transitions and animations
* Using styled-components to style elements
